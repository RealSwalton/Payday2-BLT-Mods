This mod helps you to differenciate 6 cases of hitmarkers:
- the shape of the hitmarker tells if the hit was lethal or not ;
- the color indicates the type of damage inflicted: body shot, head shot or
  critical hit.


INSTALLATION
------------

1/ First, you need BLT: http://paydaymods.com/download/

2/ Once BLT is installed, unzip this mod archive into "PAYDAY 2/mods/".

3/ Then start the game, the first time it will be minimized (due to folder
   creation).

4/ Restart the game to finalize the installation (a click on the notification
   or trying to go to the option menu will make you quit the game).

That's all.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Everything is done in the menu "Options > Mod Options > Enhanced Hitmarkers":
- textures can't be changed while a game is ongoing, only from main menu ;
- colors can be changed whenever you want.


ADD YOUR OWN HITMARKER TEXTURE (optionally)
------------------------------

If none of the texture pleases you, you can add yours in the folder
"PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides\Enhanced Hitmarkers\guis\textures\pd2".

It is possible to craft a special texture that contains 3 hitmarkers so
you get distinct bodyshot/headshot/crit. Just stack them up vertically.

You have nothing else to do: the texture lists of the option menu are done
dynamically. If it does not appear, check the obvious. Like is it the right
DDS format?
